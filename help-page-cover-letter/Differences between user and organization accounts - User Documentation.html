<p>My writing skills, technical knowledge, and experience with crafting user-friendly instructions makes me an exceptional candidate for this position. My experience providing technical support directly to customers, coupled with my excellent writing skills, enables me to compose articulate, succinct instructions for both new and experienced GitHub users.</p>

<p>Being an avid developer myself, I have been an ardent user of GitHub for quite some time. The ability to view the code of other members of the community as well as collaborate with others on my own code has proven exceptionally useful in my software development experience. As such, I am familiar with GitHub and would be more than comfortable crafting instructional guides in its use and associated services.</p>

<a id="further-reading" class="anchor" href="http://tyler-young.com/help-page-cover-letter/#professional-experience" aria-hidden="true" data-unsp-sanitized="clean"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Professional Experience</h3>

<p>I previously worked as a Customer Support agent for Media Temple, a premium web hosting provider. I worked directly with customers to troubleshoot any issues or answer any questions they may have had. I primarily worked via live chats, tickets, and Twitter. In that capacity, I regularly created written instructions for walking users through the use of Media Temple products; from simple tasks such as resetting passwords, to more complicated procedures such as identifying and mitigating DDoS attacks. My instructions were so well-received, they were regularly adapted into public-facing self-help guides on the Media Temple website. Because of this I was also regularly asked to edit instructions written by others, as well as re-write many of the official canned responses used by Customer Support and the social media team.</p>

<p>While attending Willamette University, I worked as a research assistant for the Dean of the Department of Psychology. My responsibilities included designing research projects, authoring grant proposals to obtain funding, conducting experiments, statistically analyzing the results, and writing formal reports of the research project and results. One such research project—regarding learning and human memory—was successful enough that the paper was selected to be published and presented at the annual conference of the Cognitive Science Society in Berlin, Germany. Additionally, the topic of my senior thesis was about the relationship between technology and human learning.</p>

<a id="further-reading" class="anchor" href="http://tyler-young.com/help-page-cover-letter/#personal-experience" aria-hidden="true" data-unsp-sanitized="clean"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Personal Experience</h3>

<p>Outside of employment, I have always had a devotion to software development. One such passion project has been the development of a mobile game for iOS. Although the game has yet to be finished, it has been an immensely rewarding experience. Because every aspect of the game was made by me, I learned the C# programming language as well as the softer skills of project management, creating graphics, composing music, and collaborating with other members of the independent game development community.</p>

<p>Another project of mine has been the creation of a successful, profitable currency trading algorithm, which day trades currencies on the foreign exchange market with a return on investment exceeding the S&P 500.</p> 

<p>Learning comes naturally to me, and I am able to master new skills in a timely fashion. Almost all of my skills are entirely self-taught. This, in turn, would allow me to expediently craft support guides when new products and services are released.</p>

<p>In the past I have worked freelance as a graphic designer and I am skilled with Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign (as well as the rest of the Adobe Creative Suite). Through the designing of client websites, I am comfortable using HTML, PHP, and CSS, and I am currently learning Javascript.</p>
